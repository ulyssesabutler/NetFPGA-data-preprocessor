GIT VERSION 1.8.0

Before using this code, please check the release notes for 1.8.0 below

This release contains:


1. Fix for manual test via uart not working
   - Using UART to run manual test did not work previously for reference_switch and reference_switch_lite. This has been fixed. See https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-SUME-live/issues/37

2. Fix for acceptance test crash in headless mode
   - NfSumeTest.py is run during acceptance test. This script assumed the presence of a display which caused a crash. The fix now allows the script to be run without a display.

3. New contribution - script to generate the regs_gen.py file
   - The new file csv_gen.py can be used instead of running the excel macro inside module_generation.xlsm
