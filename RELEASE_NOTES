GIT VERSION 1.9.0rc

Before using this code, please check the release notes for 1.9.0rc below

This release contains:


1. Bug Fix
   - nf_axis_converter_v1_0_0: Fix timing issue on the path between the nf_axis_converter
    and the tx_queue. The timing issue was causing the nf_axis_converter output to be incorrect, which
    in turn caused the MAC to reject packets of certain lengths.
    Added an AXIS pipeline stage on the output of the nf_axis_converter.
 
2. Contrib Projects
   - lake: Layered Key-value store, a hardware-based implementation of memcached server
   - reference_emu_dns: Implementation of a DNS server with the Emu framework and integrated into the SUME reference data path
   - nic_v2: Reference NIC with the new DMA engine core

3. Contrib Cores
   - db_v1_0_1:  A key-value cache which stores key-value pair on DRAM and BRAM
   - div_v1_0_0: A packet distributer, based on UDP port number and this module acts as in-network computing on-demand controller
   - emudns_output_port_lookup_v1_0_0: Output port lookup core generated by the Emu framework with DNS functionality
   - input_arbiter_6in_v1_0_0: Provides support for an additional internal high-priority 50Gbps queue
   - nf_naudit_dma_v1_0_0: New DMA engine
   - nf_sume_pktgen_v1_0_0: Enables internal packet injection at full speed (~50Gbps)
